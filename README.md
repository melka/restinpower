# Rest In Power

Broadcasting the names of black people killed by police as WiFi SSIDs to make them a bit more visible
via invisible radio waves...

## Intro

Since 2015, 1950 black males and females have been killed by police. 
The problem with racism in the police and the institutions is not new, George Floyd's death is just the 
tip of the iceberg that we need to see as a whole.

## Why WiFi SSIDs ?

I hope that this is just a cheap, efficient and relatively easy way to put those names in front of more people.
By broadcasting that long list as WiFi SSIDs, the people around trying to get their daily dose of Internet
while sipping their frappuccino and ignoring the problem will have to see it. It's gonna be pretty hard to 
find that access point from your favorite coffee joint in that really long list, friend.

## Hardware

Built and tested on an ESP32 (lolin32), but old code from ESP8266 compiles so it should run fine.
Just plug that board into a USB powerbank, put it into your bag and roam around the city as usual.
